# Alkene Stability Guide

## Understanding Alkene Stability

Alkene stability is a fundamental concept in organic chemistry. More stable alkenes have lower energy and are thermodynamically favored.

### Measuring Stability: Heats of Hydrogenation

The standard way to measure alkene stability is by comparing **heats of hydrogenation** (ΔH°hyd):

```
Alkene + H₂ → Alkane     ΔH°hyd
```

- All alkenes convert to the **same product** (the corresponding alkane)
- The **less negative** the ΔH, the **more stable** the alkene
- A more stable alkene releases less energy because it started closer to the product energy level

### Example Values

| Alkene | ΔH°hyd (kcal/mol) | Substitution |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Ethene | -32.8 | Unsubstituted |
| Propene | -30.1 | Monosubstituted |
| 1-Butene | -30.3 | Monosubstituted |
| trans-2-Butene | -27.6 | Disubstituted |
| cis-2-Butene | -28.6 | Disubstituted |
| 2-Methyl-2-butene | -26.9 | Trisubstituted |
| 2,3-Dimethyl-2-butene | -26.6 | Tetrasubstituted |

## Factors Affecting Stability

### 1. Degree of Substitution

**More substituted = More stable**

Stability order:
```
Tetra > Tri > Di > Mono > Unsubstituted
```

This is due to **hyperconjugation**: the overlap of C-H σ bonds from adjacent alkyl groups with the π* antibonding orbital of the double bond.

- More alkyl substituents = more hyperconjugation = more stability
- Each additional substituent provides approximately 1-3 kcal/mol stabilization

### 2. E/Z (cis/trans) Isomerism

**E (trans) is more stable than Z (cis)**

- In Z (cis) isomers, substituents on the same side create steric strain
- In E (trans) isomers, substituents are on opposite sides, minimizing steric interactions

Example:
- trans-2-Butene: -27.6 kcal/mol
- cis-2-Butene: -28.6 kcal/mol
- Difference: 1.0 kcal/mol (trans is more stable)

### 3. Ring Strain in Cyclic Alkenes

Cyclic alkenes have constraints that affect stability:
- Cyclohexene is relatively stable (similar to acyclic disubstituted)
- Smaller rings (cyclopentene, cyclobutene) have angle strain

## Using the Alkene Stability Viewer

### Comparison Sets

The viewer offers preset comparison sets:

1. **Butene Isomers**: Compare all C₄H₈ isomers
   - 1-Butene (mono)
   - cis-2-Butene (di)
   - trans-2-Butene (di)
   - Isobutylene (di)

2. **Substitution Effect**: See how stability increases with substitution
   - Ethene → Propene → 2-Methyl-2-butene → 2,3-Dimethyl-2-butene

3. **Cis vs Trans**: Compare E and Z isomers
   - cis vs trans-2-Butene
   - cis vs trans-2-Pentene

4. **Pentene Isomers**: C₅H₁₀ isomers

5. **Cyclic Alkenes**: Cyclopentene, cyclohexene, 1-methylcyclohexene

6. **Custom**: Select any combination of alkenes

### View Modes

1. **Bar Chart**: Visual comparison of heats of hydrogenation
   - Taller bars = more negative ΔH = less stable
   - Color-coded by substitution pattern
   - Green highlight on most stable

2. **Energy Diagram**: Reaction coordinate for hydrogenation
   - Shows starting alkene energies
   - All curves converge to the same product (alkane)
   - Visualizes ΔH as vertical arrows

### Quiz Mode

Test your understanding with questions about:
- Ranking alkenes by stability
- Identifying the most/least stable in a set
- Predicting which has more negative ΔH
- Identifying substitution patterns

## Key Concepts to Remember

### Stability Trends

1. **More substituted = More stable** (hyperconjugation)
2. **Trans > Cis** (less steric strain)
3. **ΔH less negative = More stable**

### Common Mistakes

1. Confusing "more negative ΔH" with "more stable"
   - More negative = LESS stable (releases more energy upon hydrogenation)

2. Forgetting that all alkenes give the same product
   - This is why we can compare starting material stability

3. Mixing up E/Z with stability
   - E (trans) is usually more stable due to less steric strain

### Exam Tips

1. For ranking questions, count substituents first
2. For isomers of same substitution, check E/Z
3. Remember key reference values:
   - Ethene: ~-33 kcal/mol (least stable common alkene)
   - Tetrasubstituted: ~-27 kcal/mol (most stable common alkene)

## Hyperconjugation Explained

Hyperconjugation stabilizes alkenes through orbital overlap:

1. The π bond has an **antibonding orbital** (π*)
2. Adjacent **C-H bonds** (σ) can overlap with π*
3. This **delocalizes electrons** and lowers energy
4. More alkyl groups = more C-H bonds = more stabilization

```
    H                π* orbital
     \              /
      C===C  ←  σ bond overlap
     /
    R
```

This is why:
- Tetrasubstituted (4 alkyl groups) > Trisubstituted (3)
- More C-H bonds available for hyperconjugation
