## Why These Tools?

In organic chemistry, understanding molecular structure and reactivity is fundamental:

**Chair Conformations** determine:
- Molecular stability based on substituent positions
- Stereochemical outcomes of reactions
- Biological activity of drugs and natural products

**Reaction Energy Diagrams** explain:
- Why certain mechanisms are favored over others
- How reaction conditions affect mechanism choice
- The relationship between activation energy and reaction rate

**E2 Stereochemistry** is critical for:
- Understanding why certain eliminations occur and others don't
- Predicting alkene geometry (E/Z) from starting material configuration
- Recognizing conformational requirements in cyclic systems
