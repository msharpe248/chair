# Organic Chemistry Visualization Suite

Welcome to the documentation for this interactive suite of tools for visualizing and understanding organic chemistry concepts.

## Available Viewers

### Chair Conformation Viewer
Visualize and analyze cyclohexane chair conformations, including:
- Interactive substituent placement with real-time energy calculations
- Pyranose sugars (glucose, galactose, mannose, etc.)
- Decalin fused ring systems
- Newman projections
- Quiz mode for practice

### Reaction Energy Diagram Viewer
Understand reaction mechanisms and thermodynamics:
- Predict mechanisms (SN1, SN2, E1, E2) from reaction conditions
- Analyze reactions from SMILES structures
- Compare competing mechanisms with overlaid energy curves
- Quiz mode to test your understanding

## Documentation Contents

### Chair Conformation Viewer
1. [Chair Conformation Theory](theory.md) - The organic chemistry behind chair conformations
2. [Using the Chair Viewer](using-the-viewer.md) - How to use this tool effectively
3. [Pyranose Sugars](sugars.md) - Understanding carbohydrate chair conformations
4. [Decalin & Fused Rings](decalin.md) - Bicyclic systems and their conformations

### Reaction Energy Diagram Viewer
1. [Reaction Energy Theory](energy-theory.md) - Understanding energy diagrams and mechanism prediction
2. [Using the Energy Viewer](energy-viewer.md) - Guide to all features of the energy diagram viewer

## Why These Tools?

In organic chemistry, understanding molecular structure and reactivity is fundamental:

**Chair Conformations** determine:
- Molecular stability based on substituent positions
- Stereochemical outcomes of reactions
- Biological activity of drugs and natural products

**Reaction Energy Diagrams** explain:
- Why certain mechanisms are favored over others
- How reaction conditions affect mechanism choice
- The relationship between activation energy and reaction rate

## Quick Start

1. Use the **dropdown menu** in the header to switch between viewers
2. Select a **mode** (Conditions, SMILES, Preset, or use the Quiz button)
3. Interact with the controls to explore different scenarios
4. Use the **? Help** link to access this documentation

## Educational Use

These tools are designed to help with:
- Visualizing abstract organic chemistry concepts
- Verifying answers to homework problems
- Understanding why certain reactions proceed as they do
- Practicing mechanism prediction and identification
