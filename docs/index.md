4. [Decalin & Fused Rings](decalin.md) - Bicyclic systems and their conformations

## What is This Tool?

This viewer helps students and educators visualize **chair conformations** of six-membered rings. Chair conformations are fundamental to understanding:

- Conformational analysis in organic chemistry
- Stereochemistry of cyclohexane derivatives
- Carbohydrate chemistry (sugars)
- Steroid and terpene structures
- Drug molecule conformations

## Why Chair Conformations Matter

In organic chemistry, the three-dimensional shape of molecules determines their:

- **Reactivity** - Which atoms are accessible for reactions
- **Stability** - Which conformations are lower in energy
- **Biological activity** - How molecules interact with enzymes and receptors

The chair conformation is the most stable form of cyclohexane and its derivatives. Understanding how substituents prefer axial or equatorial positions is essential for predicting molecular behavior.

## Quick Start

1. **Cyclohexane Mode**: Click on any carbon to add substituents. See how the energy changes based on axial vs. equatorial placement.

2. **Sugar Mode**: Explore common monosaccharides like glucose and galactose. Toggle between α and β anomers.

3. **Decalin Mode**: Compare cis and trans fused ring systems.

## Features

- Interactive substituent placement
- Real-time energy calculations using A-values
- Ring flip visualization
- Axial/equatorial position labels
- Zoom and pan controls
- Support for pyranose sugars and decalin

## Educational Use

This tool is designed to help with:

- Verifying answers to conformational analysis problems
- Understanding 1,3-diaxial interactions
- Visualizing the anomeric effect in sugars
- Comparing conformational isomers
